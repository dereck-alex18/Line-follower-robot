This project is a robotic car to follow a line in a white floor (Also known as line follower robot) . To build it was used:

    1) Arduino UNO
    2) 2 TCRT5000 (to detect the color of the line)
    3) One IR receiver (To receive how many laps the car should take)
    4) 2 DC motors
    5) One chassis
    6) One H bridge
    7) Batteries and wires

The car has to follow the line correctly and take the number of laps that was determined before it starts to follow the line.
